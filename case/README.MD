The case uses a 3-part design. The PCB is sandwiched between the plate and bottom, and the borders are screwed on top.
This design is easier to 3D-print and assemble, but has a thin seam visible between the plate and the borders.
There us no tenting version planned at this point, but the bottom part of the case can easily be swapped for another design.

You may find exported 3MF files for both sides of the keyboard [here](/3MF) or tweak and export each component manually from a complete build [here](/STEP/full.step)

## 3D Printing Guidelines

3D printing of the 3-part design is pretty straightforward. I printed all of the parts upside down on my A1 Mini with no supports, and they all turned out great. The case consists of straight walls and flat surfaces, which all 3d printers can manage at relatively high speeds without significant quality losses. 
The bottom plate can be printed at the lowest quality preset, as it is not visible and serves solely to stick silicone non-slip pads.
Print keycaps at an angle with supports to minimize the visibility of layer lines.

## Keycaps

I used the KLP Lame keycaps by [Braindefender](https://github.com/braindefender/KLP-Lame-Keycaps). Feel free to experiment with your own keycap choices or use a different configuration of KLP keycaps.
The keyboard shown on the pictures in this repository uses "Saddle Tilted", "Saddle" and "Saddle Homing" for the main 4x5 grid, "Normal" for the two side buttons and "Thumb" for the thumb cluster.
