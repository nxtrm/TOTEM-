TOTEM++ is a 50 key column-staggered choc split keyboard. It is meant to be used with a [Seeed Studio XIAO nRF52840 BLE](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeed-XIAO-BLE-nRF52840-p-5201.html). 
This is an iteration on the TOTEM project by [GEIST](https://github.com/GEIGEIGEIST/TOTEM/tree/main) for those who like the design of the keyboard, but would like to have a few extra keys to ease the transition from larger keyboards.
[Here](https://www.hackster.io/geist/totem-a-tiny-splitkeyboard-with-splay-cb2e43) you can read about the process of making the original board.

## CASE

You can use the TOTEM without a case, but [here](/case/) you can find one I made for it.

***

## BUILD GUIDE

The build guide for the TOTEM can be found [here](/docs/buildguide.md) (works for TOTEM++).

***

## FIRMWARE

[ZMK precompiled](/firmware/) or [ZMK source (recommended)](https://github.com/nxtrm/zmk-config) for the TOTEM (wireless using the XIAO BLE)

### INSPIRATION

When i was researching the ergo keyboard market, I couldnt find a keyboard better looking (and cheaper to build) than the TOTEM, but with 38 keys, it was too overwhelming to migrate to it from my TKL keyboard.
To ease this transition, I added an extra row of keys (12 in total) to the design.
